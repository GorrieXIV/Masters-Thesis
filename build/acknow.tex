\vspace{1.0in}
First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisor Douglas Stebila, whose expertise and mentorship have motivated and focused me greatly over the past few years. This research would also not have been possible without the work and guidance of researchers and developers at Microsoft Research's NExT Security \& Cryptography group as well as Waterloo University's Institute for Quantum Computing.

I would also like to deeply thank my fellow peers and colleagues at McMaster University who, through years of genial conversation, have helped to foster my curiosity, imagination, and passion for science and mathematics.
