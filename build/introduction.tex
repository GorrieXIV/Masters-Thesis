Over the course of the past decade, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has proven itself a mainstay in the wide world of applied cryptology. While isogeny based cryptography does build itself up from the same underlying field of mathematics as ECC, it simultaneously draws from a slightly more complicated space of algebraic notions. Much of this chapter will be dedicated to illuminating these notions in a manner that should be digestable for those without serious background in algebraic geometry, or abstract algebra in general.
