\chapter{Introduction}

The past 30 years have brought with them astonishing developments in the field of Quantum Computing. As physicists and engineers race towards error-free and energy efficient implementations of quantum computers, we steadfastly approach a New Age for the art and science of Cryptography.  have come also remarkably. Quantum computers 

\section{Motivation}

Our aim is to improve the efficiency (thus improving the practicality) of isogeny based schemes. More specifically, we will be investigating the C implementation of the Yoo et al. isogeny based signature scheme. 


\section{Contributions}

Our explicit contributions to the implementation of this protocol are twofold. Our first contribution involves the implementation of a procedure for batching . This scheme leverages the already parallel nature of the protocol, and.

Additionally, because the compression algorithm in question is itself tenable two contributions can be 


\section{Structure}



\subsection{Layout}

Over the course of the past decade, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has proven itself a mainstay in the wide world of applied cryptology. While isogeny based cryptography does build itself up from the same underlying field of mathematics as ECC, it simultaneously draws from a slightly more complicated space of algebraic notions. Much of this chapter will be dedicated to illuminating these notions in a manner that should be digestable for those without serious background in algebraic geometry, or abstract algebra in general.

\subsection{Notation}

To denote high-level procedures, we write their titls in \textbf{bold}. Procedures intended for machine execution are titled with \code{monospace} font - and we use the same notation for C modules, functions, and variable name.
