\chapter{Compressing Signatures}
\label{sec:compress}

Our second contribution, also in the form of an addendum to the \sidh signature extension, is a mechanism for compressing signatures to reduce the size.

We explore two approaches to reducing the size of the Yoo et al. signatures. Both of these approaches, soon to be discussed, leverage the recently publishes point compression technique as seen in \cite{pkcomp}. 

Costello et al. showed in \cite{pkcomp} that  

\section{SIDH Key Compression Background}

We discussed rejection sampling A values from signature public keys until we found an A that was also the x-coord of a point. After some simple analysis, however, we found that it was extremely unlikely for A to be a point on the curve.
