\chapter{Compressing Signatures}
\label{sec:compress}

Our second contribution, also in the form of an addendum to the \sidh signature extension, is a mechanism for compressing signatures to reduce the size.

Costello et al. showed in \cite{pkcomp} that  

\section{SIDH Key Compression Background}

We discussed rejection sampling A values from signature public keys until we found an A that was also the x-coord of a point. After some simple analysis, however, we found that it was extremely unlikely for A to be a point on the curve.
