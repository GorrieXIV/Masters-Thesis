\chapter{Compressing Signatures}
\label{ch:compress}

Our second contribution to the \sidh signature library is a mechanism for compressing signatures. This chapter will cover the compression technique used. This chapter, much like the last, will be split into three sections: a brief coverage of the employed compression technique, the details of our implementation and integration of this technique into \sidh, and finally an analysis of the results of this contribution.

In the first section of this chapter, we discuss the SIDH public key compression technique resulting from combined efforts of Azerderakhsh et al. \cite{compwr} and Costello et al. \cite{pkcomp}. We attempt to provide a sufficient overview of the technique while only covering in detail the components that are of significant relevance to our implementation. Those who seek to better understand the ins and outs of this technique should direct themselves to the original papers.

The second section covers in detail how we apply this public key compression to Yoo et al. signatures. We make use of the functions offered by Costello et al. which implement the previously mentioned technique. This code was first made available in the second installment of Microsoft's SIDH library \cite{sidhcode}.

Finally, we round off the Chapter with an analysis of the bandwidth improvement offered by this technique. We contrast this spatial improvement with the computational cost of compressing points, and discuss the practicality of employing this technique.

\section{SIDH Key Compression Background}

In this section we will briefly cover the literature surrounding the compression technique that we employ. This technique was first outlined by Azerderakhsh et al. \cite{compwr} and later improved upon by Costello et al. \cite{pkcomp}. Here we investigate the details of these works that are relevant to our implementation.\\

\noindent
First, recall from Section \ref{subsec:sidhkex} the structure of an SIDH public key, denoted $pk$;
$$
pk = (E, P, Q)
$$
Where $E$ is a supersingular elliptic curve and $P$ and $Q$ are elliptic curve points such that $P, Q \in E$. Recall that $E$ can be sufficiently represented by one $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ element which denotes $A$ from the following definition of $E$:
$$
E : y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B.
$$

$A$ sufficiently represents $E$ in this context because in \sidh we are concerned only with curves where $B$ = 0.

$P$ and $Q$, on the other hand, can each be represented by their $x$-coordinate (two $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ elements) and a single bit determining the correct $y$-coordinate. Therefore, without more sophisticated compression, an \sidh public key can be represented with $~6\log p$ bits.

\subsection{Compressing SIDH Public Keys}
\label{subsec:azercompression}

Recall the discrete logarithm problem in the context of elliptic curves: given an elliptic curve group $E(K)$ and points $P, Q \in E(K)$, find $n$ such that $P = nQ$. The two-dimensional discrete log problem is then the following: given an elliptic curve group $E(K)$, two points $\{R_1, R_2\}$ generating a subgroup $H$ of $E(K)$, and an element $P_{H} \in H$, compute $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that:
$$
P_{H} = \alpha R_1 + \beta R_2
$$
The Pohlig-Hellman algorithm can be applied to solve the discrete logarithm problem in groups whose order is a smooth integer \cite{ph}, and there is a variation of this algorithm which solves this two-dimensional discrete log problem with time complexity $O(\sqrt[q][\log p])$, where $q$ is the largest prime dividing $\vert H\vert$ \cite{genph}.\\

\noindent
Azerderakhsh et al. show that an SIDH public key can be compressed in the following way. Taking \alice's SIDH key pair, for example, we have her public key $\pka = (E_{\ba}, \pa(\genpb),\pa(\genqb))$ and her private key $\ska = \ma$ such that $ker(\pa) = \langle \genpa + [\ma]\genqa\rangle$. Because $\{\genpb, \genqb\}$ generates the torsion subgroup $E
_{\ba}[\lbeb]$, we have that $\pa(\genpb) \in E[\lbeb]$ and $\pa(\genqb) \in E[\lbeb]$. Thus, the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm can be used to resolve $\pa(\genpb) = [\alpha_P] R_1 + [\beta_P] R_2$ and $\pa(\genqb) = \alpha_Q R_1 + \beta_Q R_2$ where $\{R_1, R_2\}$ is a basis for $E_{\ba}[\lbeb]$ \cite{compwr}.

Then, instead of sending \bob $(E_{\ba}, \pa(\genpb),\pa(\genqb))$, \alice can send $(E_{\ba}, \alpha_P, \beta_P, \alpha_Q,\allowbreak{} \beta_Q)$.\footnote{The approach outlined by Azerderakhsh et al. involves sending the $j$-invariant of $E$, which can be represented with the same amount of space as one $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ element. Because we are working in \sidh where we can already represent curves with one $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ element, we omit this detail.} And so, as long as \alice and \bob can seperately generate the same $\{R_1, R_2\}$, they can both sufficiently represent one anothers public keys with only $4\log p$ bits.\\

\noindent
\textit{Constructing the Basis}. Constructing $R_1$ and $R_2$ can be done with a relatively simple yet time consuming process. We will continue to use the compression of \alice's public key, $\pka$, as our example.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose a random point $P \leftarrow_{\$} E(\mathbb{F}_{p^2})$.
\item Multiply $P$ by $\lbeb \cdot f$ to obtain $P'$, the order of which will divide $\lbeb$.
\item Check the order of $P'$ by multiplying it by powers of $\la$ until the identity is given.
\item If the order is $\lbeb$, set $R_1 = P'$, otherwise return to step one.
\item Repeat the same process for a new random point $Q$ until $Q'$ of order $\lbeb$ is found.
\item Check that $Q'$ is independent of $R_1$ by computing their Weil pairing: $e(R_1, Q')$.
\item If the pairing results in anything other than 1, set $R_2 = Q'$, otherwise return to step 5.
\end{enumerate}

The same $(R_1, R_2)$ pair will be derived by both \alice and \bob if they use a psuedorandom number generator for generating $P$ and $Q$ AND they run their PRNGs with identical seeds \cite{compwr}.

The literature, to our knowledge, has thus far neglected the details of generating and transmitting this common seed necessary for basis generation. We note that the seed can be generated by the signer (using any PRF of their liking) and transmitted with their public key (which needs only to be sent once).\\

\noindent
\textit{Decompressing Public Keys}. Decompression for this technique varies depending on the setting, but for our purpose we are concerned only with how decompression is done for SIDH key exchange. \bob computes the basis $\{R_1, R_2\}$ by seeding his PRNG with the same value as \alice. \bob then uses $\alpha_P, \beta_P, \alpha_Q$ and $\beta_Q$ to recompute $\pa(\genpb)$ and $\pa(\genqb)$. Then \bob computes the isogeny $\phi'_{\rb} : E_{\ba} \rightarrow E_{\ba\rb}$ with $ker(\phi'_{B}) =$ \cite{compwr}.

\alice then acts identically on \bob's now compressed public key, $\pkb$, and the two arrive at the same shared secret, the $j$-invariant of $E_{\ba\rb}$, just as in the original SIDH key exchange.\footnote{We have omitted details from this method of compression that are concerned with potential \textit{twists} of \alice and \bob's curves when compressing public keys, as this does not play a role in our implementation. }

\subsection{Improvements to SIDH Key Compression}
\label{subsec:costcompression}

The work of Costello et al. further developed this approach to achieve public key sizes of $\frac{7}{2}\log p$ \cite{pkcomp}. In addition to this, Costello et al. also outline several algorithmic improvements which decrease the runtime of this compression mechanism.

Many of the algorithms offered by Costello et al. can be treated as black-boxes in our setting, and so finer grained details of their work on efficient compression are omitted.\\

\noindent
\textit{Improved Compression.} Take \alice's public key $\pka$, compressed via the Azerderakhsh et al. technique, to be $(E_{\ba}, \alpha_{P}, \beta_{P}, \alpha_{Q}, \beta_{Q})$. Therefore we have
$$
P = \alpha_{P}R_1 + \beta_{P}R_2,
$$
$$
Q = \alpha_{Q}R_1 + \beta_{Q}R_2;
$$
Where $\{R_1, R_2\}$ forms a basis of $E_{\ba}[\lbeb]$, and $P$ and $Q$ are exactly the elliptic curve point components of \alice's original, uncompressed public key.

From here, Costello et al. note the following: The end goal of the key exchange (in our running example) is for \bob to compute $\langle P + \mb Q\rangle$, where $\mb$ is \bob's secretly generated value. Given that $P$ has order $n = \lbeb$, we have that either $\alpha_{P} \in \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{n}$ or $\beta_{P} \in \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{n}$, and so it follows that
$$
\langle P + \mb Q \rangle =  \begin{cases}
							\langle \alpha^{-1}_{P}P + \alpha^{-1}\mb Q \rangle & \text{if }\ \alpha_{P} \in \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{n}\\
							\langle \beta^{-1}_{P}P + \beta^{-1}\mb Q \rangle & \text{if }\ \beta_{P} \in \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{n}
							\end{cases}
$$
And so, computing $\langle P + \mb Q\rangle$ to arrive at the shared secret does not require recomputing $P$ and $Q$. Instead, the scalar factors of $P$ and $Q$ with respect to the generated basis can be normalized to yield
$$
(\alpha^{-1}_{P}P, \alpha^{-1}_{P}Q) = (R_{1} + \alpha^{-1}_{P}\beta_{P} R_{2}, \alpha^{-1}_{P}\alpha_{Q}R_{1} + \alpha^{-1}_{P}\beta_{Q}R_{2})
$$
when $\alpha_{P} \in \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{n}$, or
$$
(\beta^{-1}_{P}P, \beta^{-1}_{P}Q) = (R_{1} + \beta^{-1}_{P}\alpha_{P} R_{2}, \beta^{-1}_{P}\alpha_{Q}R_{1} + \beta^{-1}_{P}\beta_{Q}R_{2}
$$
if $\beta_{P} \in \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{n}$.\\

\noindent
And, thus, \alice has reduced the information she needs to send over the wire from $(E_{\ba}, \pa(\genpb), \pa(\genqb))$ to the following:
$$
\pka = \begin{cases}
	   (E_{\ba}, 0, \alpha^{-1}_{P}\beta_{P}, \alpha^{-1}_{P}\alpha_{Q}, \alpha^{-1}_{P}\beta_{Q}) & \text{if }\ \alpha_{P} \in \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{n}\\
	   (E_{\ba}, 1, \beta^{-1}_{P}\alpha_{P}, \beta^{-1}_{P}\alpha_{Q}, \beta^{-1}_{P}\beta_{Q}) & \text{if }\ \beta_{P} \in \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{n}
	   \end{cases}
$$
Or, alternatively we write
$$
\pka = \begin{cases}
	   (E_{\ba}, 0, \zeta_{P}, \alpha'_{Q}, \beta'_{Q}) & \text{if }\ \alpha_{P} \in \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{n}\\
	   (E_{\ba}, 1, \zeta'_{P}, \alpha'_{Q}, \beta'_{Q}) & \text{if}\ \beta_{P} \in \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{n}
	   \end{cases}
$$
for readability. This reduction from 4 $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_{n}$ elements to 3 takes \alice's compressed public key from $4\log p$ bits to $\frac{7}{2}\log p$ bits.\\

\noindent
\textit{Alternative Decompression.} Due to the loss of information in either $\alpha_{P}$ or $\beta_{P}$, an alternative route to secret agreement is required. For a compressed public key $(E, b, \zeta_{P}, \alpha_{Q}, \beta_{Q})$ there exists a $\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{n}$ such that
$$
(\gamma^{-1}P, \gamma^{-1}Q) =
\begin{cases}
(R_1 + \zeta_{P}R_2, \alpha_{Q}R_1 + \beta_{Q}R_2) & \text{if }\ b = 0\\
(\zeta_{P}R_1 + R_2, \alpha_{Q}R_1 + \beta_{Q}R_2) & \text{if }\ b = 1
\end{cases}
$$
The verifier could reconstruct $\{R_1, R_2\}$ to produce $\langle P + mQ \rangle$ by computing $P$ and $Q$ from $\zeta_{P}, \alpha_{Q}, \beta_{Q}$ with $R_1$ and $R_2$, and then multiplying $Q$ by their private key $m$. This would require a 1-dimensional and a 2-dimensional scalar multiplication of points on the curve $E$. Costello et al. note instead that
$$
\langle P + mQ \rangle =
\begin{cases}
\langle (1 + m\alpha_{Q}) R_1 + (\zeta_{P} + m\beta_{Q})R_2 \rangle & \text{if }\ b = 0\\
\langle (\zeta_{P} + m\alpha_{Q})R_1 + (1 + m\beta_{Q})R_2 \rangle & \text{if }\ b = 1
\end{cases}
$$
And since $n=l^{e}$ we have $(1 + m\alpha_{Q}), (1 + m\beta_{Q}) \in \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{n}$, giving
$$
\langle P + mQ \rangle =
\begin{cases}
\langle R_1 + (1 + m\alpha_{Q})(\zeta_{P} + m\beta_{Q})R_2 \rangle & \text{if }\ b = 0\\
\langle (1 + m\beta_{Q})(\zeta_{P} + m\alpha_{Q})R_1 + R_2 \rangle & \text{if }\ b = 1
\end{cases}
$$
reducing decompression to a single 1-dimensional scalar multiplication of a point on $E$ along with a handful of $\mathbb{F}_{p^{2}}$ operations.


\section{Implementation Details}
\label{sec:compimplementation}

In this section we demonstrate how the previously detailed public key compression technique can be used to compress a Yoo signature. Again, we will turn to the \sidh library and reference portions of C code (some contributed by Patrick Longa \cite{sidhcode}, some by Yoo and his associates \cite{yoosigcode}, and some by us) to investigate details of our implementations performance.\\

\noindent
Recall from Section \ref{sec:sigsbackground} the structure of a Yoo et al. signature, $\sigma$:
$$
\sigma = (com, ch, h, resp)
$$

\noindent
where

\begin{itemize}
\item $com$ is a list of $2\lambda$ pairs of supersingular elliptic curves: \allowbreak{$\{(E_{1,1}, E_{2,1}), (E_{1,2},\allowbreak{} E_{2,2}),\allowbreak{} ...,\allowbreak{} (E_{1,2\lambda}, E_{2,2\lambda})\}$,}
\item $ch$ is a list of $2\lambda$ randomly chosen bits,
\item $resp$ is a list of size $2\lambda$ where each element is either a single elliptic curve point $\pr(S)$, where $\pr$ is \randall's isogeny and $S$ is the signers secretly generated point, or the pair of points ($\cyr, \phi(\cyr)$), where $\cyr$ is \randall's secretly generated point, and $\phi$ is the signers isogeny.
\item $h$ is a list of $2\lambda$ queries to a random oracle \textbf{G}, such that $h_{i} = \textbf{G(}resp_{i}\textbf{)}$
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Recall also from Subsection \ref{subsec:datarep} the following definitions:
\begin{itemize}
\item an \code{felm\_t} denotes a $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ element, e.g. a 751-bit integer,
\item an \code{f2elm\_t} denotes an $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ element, represented as two \code{felm\_t}s,
\item a \code{point\_affine} denotes an elliptic curve point represented in affine space (two \code{f2elm\_t}s), and
\item a \code{point\_proj} denotes an elliptic curve point represented in projective space (two \code{f2elm\_t}s).
\end{itemize}

\vspace{10px}
\noindent
The representation of $\sigma$ in \sidh (as implemented by Yoo et al.) has a few noteworthy differences. Signatures in this setting are defined via a C \code{struct} in the following way:\\

\begin{lstlisting}
struct Signature {
	f2elm_t *Commitments1[NUM_ROUNDS];
	f2elm_t *Commitments2[NUM_ROUNDS];
	unsigned char *HashResp;
	felm_t *Randoms[NUM_ROUNDS];
	point_proj *psiS[NUM_ROUNDS];
};
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{15px}

with \code{NUM\_ROUNDS} equal to $2\lambda$. The bit-level security of a given signature, then, can be computed as $\code{NUM\_ROUNDS}/2$.

\code{Commitments1} is an array containing the first entry from every pair in $resp$, e.g.\ $\{E_{1,1}, E_{1,2}, ..., E_{1,2\lambda}\}$, and \code{Commitments2} holds the second entry from each pair.

\code{HashResp} contains the elements of $h$. In practice the Keccak function\footnote{Keccak is a cryptographic hash function from which the newly standardized SHA-3 is based \cite{sha3}.} is used in place of the random oracle \textbf{G}. 32-byte hash digests are computed using Keccak such that \code{HashResp[i]} = \code{Randoms[i/2]} if the challenge bit $ch$ is 0, and \code{HashResp[i]} = \code{psiS[i/2]} if $ch$ is 1.

\code{Randoms} is an array of $\lambda$ \code{felm\_t}'s. The element at index $i$ of \code{Randoms} holds $\mr_{i}$, and represents \randall's secretly generated $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ value for iteration $i$ of the signing algorithm. These values sufficiently represent the elements of $resp$ which take the form ($\cyr, \phi(\cyr)$) for two reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\cyr$ can be reconstructed using the torsion subgroup generating points that correspond to \randall ($\cyr = \genpa + \mr_{i}\genqa$ if \bob is signing, and $\cyr = \genpb + \mr_{i}\genqb$ if \alice is signing)
\item Because isogenies are (structure preserving) morphisms, it holds that $\cyr = P + [\mr]Q \Rightarrow \phi(\cyr) = \phi(P) + [\mr]\phi(Q)$. Thus, because $\phi(P)$ and $\phi(Q)$ are members of the signers public key, $\mr$ is sufficient for reconstructing $\phi(\cyr)$.
\end{enumerate}

Lastly, \code{psiS} denotes the elements of $resp$ which take the form of $\pr(S)$. These points cannot be represented by a single \code{felm\_t} (as in \code{Randoms}) because doing so would leak the signers private information.\\

\subsection{$\psi(S)$ Compression}

For the following two subsections we will assume the signer to be \bob (e.g. using \rb values) and the verifier to be \alice (e.g. using \ba vaues). This is done only for simplicities sake - to reverse the roles one need only to swap all \textcolor{blue}{blue} variables with their \textcolor{red}{red} counterparts, and vice-versa. Additionally, function names ending in \code{\_B} would then need to be replaced with their \code{\_A} alternatives, and vice-versa.\\

\noindent
Our contribution offers an implementation to carry out the idea of compressing every element of \code{psiS} (as proposed by Yoo et al.) by using the compression technique covered in the previous section. Consider the following.

Each element of \code{psiS} has the form $\pr(S) = \pr(\genpb) + [\mb]\pr(\genqb)$. $(\genpb, \genqb)$ generates the torsion subgroup $E[\lbeb]$ so we know that $S$ has order $\lbeb$ (e.g. $[\lbeb]S = \mathcal{O}$) and, because isogenies preserve the identity we know $[\lbeb]\pr(S) = \mathcal{O}$ and $\pr(S) \in E_{\cyr}[\lbeb]$. Therefore, we can be certain that the compression technique of the previous subsection can be applied to all elements of \code{psiS} if we chose our basis $\{R_1, R_2\}$ such that it generates $E_{\cyr}[\lbeb]$.

Recall that \bob has private key $\skb = \mb$ from which we can generate $S = \genpb + [\mb]\genqb$ and $\pb: E \rightarrow E/\langle S \rangle$, and public key $\pkb = (E_{\rb}, \pb(\genpa), \pb(\genqa))$. Recall also from previous sections that the general procedure for signature signing begins with \bob calling the \code{isogeny\_sign} function, which in turn spawns $2\lambda$ threads, each executing \code{sign\_thread}. Each of these threads has an identifier \code{r}, and performs the following via \code{sign\_thread}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Makes a call to \code{KeyGeneration\_A} to generate \randall's keypair $(\pkr, \skr)$
\begin{itemize}
\item $\skr = \mr$
\item $\pkr = (E_{\cyr}, \pr(\genpb), \pr(\genqb))$ where $\pr: E \rightarrow E_{\cyr}$
\end{itemize}
\item Sets \code{Randoms[r]} $\gets \skr$
\item Sets \code{Commitments1[r]} $\gets E_{\cyr}$
\item Performs \code{SecretAgreement\_B} with $\skb$ and $\pkr$ to generate $(E_{\rb\cyr}, \pr(S))$.
\item Sets \code{Commitments2[r]} $\gets E_{\rb\cyr}$
\item Sets \code{psiS[r]} $\gets \pr(S)$
\end{enumerate}

And so, if we wish to apply point compression to the elements of \code{psiS}, we must invoke our compression function within every \code{sign\_thread} instance, after the execution of \code{SecretAgreement\_B}. We provide a function \code{CompressPsiS}, based on the original point compression function of Costello et al. \cite{pkcomp}. This modified program path for \code{sign\_thread} is outlined in Figure \ref{fig:signcallgraph}.

\vspace{15px}
\noindent
\textit{The \code{CompressPsiS} Function}. On round \code{r} of signature signing, our compression function takes the following as parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \code{point\_proj} \code{psiS[r]},
\item an \code{f2elm\_t} \code{A}, denoting $E_{\cyr}$ (equivalently \code{Commitments1[r]}), and
\item the set of curve parameters \code{CurveIsogeny}, which we set equal to \code{SIDHp751}.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
And the output of \code{CompressPsiS} includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item a number \code{CompressedPsiS} $\in E_{\cyr}[\lbeb]$, and
\item the bit \code{compBit}.
\end{itemize}

Our compression algorithm then follows closely the technique of Azerderakhsh et al., making use of the efficient algorithms provided by Costello et al. An abstracted and generalized version of this function can be seen in Figure \ref{alg:compresspsis} as \textbf{CompressPsiS}. For our concrete C definition see Appendix \ref{app:functions}.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{-- \textbf{CompressPsiS($\pr(S)_{\code{r}}$, $E_{\cyr}$, $User$)}}
\label{alg:compresspsis}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\If{$User$ = $\alice$}
	\State $l^e \gets \laea$
\EndIf
\If{$User$ = $\bob$}
	\State $l^e \gets \lbeb$
\EndIf

\State $\text{Check that } \pr(S_{\code{r}}) \text{ has order } l^e$

\State $\text{Generate} (R_{1}, R_{2}) \text{ as the basis for } E_{\cyr}[l^e]$

\State \text{Compute $\alpha$, $\beta$ such that $\pr(S)_{\code{r}} = \alpha R_{1} + \beta R_{2}$}

\If{$\alpha \mod l \neq 0$}
	\State $b \gets 0$
	\State $\gamma \gets \alpha^{-1}\beta$
\Else
	\State $b \gets 1$
	\State $\gamma \gets \beta^{-1}\alpha$
\EndIf

\State \Return $(\gamma, b)$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\code{CompressPsiS} returns an element of $E_{\cyr}[\lbeb]$ (denoted by $\gamma$ in Figure \ref{alg:compresspsis}) which becomes \code{compPsiS[r]}. This element can be represented with fewer bytes than an element of $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ because $\vert E_{\cyr}[\lbeb] \vert = \lbeb$. The \code{Signature} structure used to construct $\sigma$ is necessarily modified as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
struct Signature {
	f2elm_t *Commitments1[NUM_ROUNDS];
	f2elm_t *Commitments2[NUM_ROUNDS];
	unsigned char *HashResp;
	felm_t *Randoms[NUM_ROUNDS];
	point_proj *psiS[NUM_ROUNDS];
	\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{-0.75\baselineskip}
\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor=\color{light-green}, firstnumber=7]
	digit_t compPsiS[NUM_ROUNDS][NWORDS_ORDER];
	int compBit[NUM_ROUNDS];
	int compressed;
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{-0.75\baselineskip}
\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=10]
};
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{15px}

Note the additional bit value \code{compressed} in the \code{Signature} struct. It is important that this bit is packaged as part of the final signature so that the verifier knows whether or not they need to perform decompression. We have also included an array of bits, $2\lambda$ in size, such that \code{compPsiS[r] =}  $\alpha^{-1}\beta$ if \code{compBit[r] = 0} and \code{compPsiS[r] =} $\beta^{-1}\alpha$ otherwise ($b$ in Figure \ref{alg:compresspsis}).

\subsection{Verifying A Compressed Signature}

Decompression can be embedded into \code{verify\_thread} rather simply. On the code path where $ch = 1$, the verifier (\alice in our case) simply needs to run decompression on \code{compPsiS[r]} and \code{compBit[r]} before she runs \code{SecretAgreement\_B}. Figure \ref{fig:verifycallgraph} reflects this modified code path at a high level.

However, if we look back to the SIDH public key decompression mechanism described in Subsection \ref{subsec:costcompression}, we note again that the aim is \textit{not} to reconstruct the originally compressed values. Instead, an instance of compressed SIDH key exchange is able to arrive at the shared secret $j(E_{\ba\rb})$ between \alice and \bob without reconstructing the original points, by absorbing the constants into the shared secret value.

This means that in transmitting \code{compPsiS[r]} in its normalized form we lose the ability to reconstruct $\pr(S)$ exactly. We are only able to construct the point $S^{0} = R_1 + \code{compPsiS[r]}R_2$, or $S^{0} = \code{compPsiS[r]}R_1 + R_2$ depending on \code{compBit[r]}. Looking back to the definition of the \textbf{Verify} procedure (Figure \ref{alg:verifysig}), we note that the verification path where $ch = 1$ requires that \alice checks 1) that $\pr(S)$ has order $\lbeb$, and 2) that $\pr(S)$ generates the kernel of the isogeny $\pr' : E_{\cyr} \rightarrow E_{\rb\cyr}$. Thus, we needn't return to the original $\pr(S)$ value to successfully verify because
\begin{enumerate}
\item if $R_1$ and $R_2$ have order $\lbeb$ (which by definition they do) and \code{compPsiS[r]} is a multiple of $\lb$, then $S^{0}$ is guaranteed to have order $\lbeb$, and
\item $S^{0}$ and $\pr(S)$ having equivalent order implies that they generate the same kernel.
\end{enumerate}

And so, \code{DecompressPsiS} can be defined to generate the same basis $\{R_1, R_2\}$ as in \code{CompressPsiS} and then compute $S^{0} = R_1 + [\code{compPsiS[r]}]R_2$ if \code{compBit} = 0 and $S^{0} = [\code{compPsiS[r]}]R_1 + R_2$ otherwise. The resulting $S^{0}$ is then passed to  \code{SecretAgreement\_B} just as in uncompressed verification and the verification will run successfully. Algorithm \ref{alg:decompresspsis} outlines the general functioning of \code{DecompressPsiS} at a high level, for our specific C implementation see Appendix \ref{app:functions}.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{-- \textbf{DecompressPsiS($\gamma$, $b$, $E_{\cyr}$, $User$)}}
\label{alg:decompresspsis}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\If{$User$ = $\alice$}
	\State $l^e \gets \lbeb$
\EndIf
\If{$User$ = $\bob$}
	\State $l^e \gets \laea$
\EndIf

\State $\text{Check that } \pr(S_{\code{r}}) \text{ has order } l^e$

\State $\text{Generate} (R_{1}, R_{2}) \text{ as the basis for } E_{\cyr}[l^e]$

\If{$b = 0$}
	\State $b \gets 0$
	\State $S^{0} \gets R_1 + [\gamma]R_2$
\Else
	\State $b \gets 1$
	\State $S^{0} \gets [\gamma]R_1 + R_2$
\EndIf

\State \Return $S^{0}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Results}

Let $\sigma$ denote an umcompressed Yoo et al. isogeny-based signature. The size of $\sigma$ can be computed as the sum of the sizes of its constituent parts. To reiterate, $\sigma$ is composed of:
\begin{itemize}
\item $4\lambda$ $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ elements (the commitments), totaling $384\lambda$ bytes,
\item $2\lambda$ Keccak hash-function digests, totaling $64\lambda$ bytes,
\item ${\sim}\lambda$ elements of $\mathbb{Z}/\laea\mathbb{Z}$ (\randall's secret key value), totaling ${\sim}48\lambda$ bytes, and
\item ${\sim}\lambda$ elliptic curve points ($\pr(S)$ points), totaling ${\sim}92\lambda$ bytes
\end{itemize}

Therefore, in the case where the challenge bits are equally divided between $1$ and $0$, $\vert \sigma \vert = 688\lambda$ bytes.

Let $\sigma_{\text{compressed}}$ denote a compressed Yoo et al. signature using the techniques outlined by Azerderakhs et al. and Costello et al. $\sigma_{\text{compressed}}$ swaps the buffer of ${\sim}\lambda$ elliptic curve points for one of ${\sim}\lambda$ $\mathbb{Z}/\lbeb\mathbb{Z}$ elements. This subtracts ${\sim}192\lambda$ bytes from the size of the signature and adds ${\sim}48\lambda$ bytes - reducing the signature size by ${\sim}144\lambda$ bytes for a final size of $544\lambda$ bytes. In the case of \sidh, this takes us from 88,064 byte signatures to 68,632 byte signatures. These improvements are presented again in Table \ref{fig:sigsizeresults}.\\
