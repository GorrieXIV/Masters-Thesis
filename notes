- if we convert from seconds to clockcycles, make note of that in the writing

- openssl speed ecdsap256

- sphincs, qtesla, rainbow, 

- compare algorithms at the same security level
  - only select things from level one NIST security leve (or equivalently 128 bit security) to compare with SIDH numbers

- api.h in dan's LibPQCrypto

context, motivation, and contributions
convice the reader you're doing something useful:
- explain something they can relate to and understand
- propose a problem in that setting
- offer a solution

- convince parents i didn't waste 2 years
- explain to an expert what it is i did
- convince the examiners i earned my masters

lay out the expectations:
- what areas are important to us?
- were concerned with aspects of the signature implementation that do not rely on the underlying algebraic properties of the structures
- can you prove this? well my focus was on this stuff, if you want to read more about that look over here
- in questions, don't BS. here's what i know, here's what i don't know, here's where I would look if i needed to know more.

in 1.0:
- three sentence introduction to cryptography
- where is it used?
- public and private keys

in 1.1:
- there is a thing called a signature scheme
- a signer needs a pair of keys
- they use the private key to sign a message
- verifiers can use the public key to verify
- signatures are used for integrity and verification

1.2:
- include conclusive contributions in this section

1.3:
- merge the stuff that's worth keeping from layout into contributions
- some of the stuff here is too meta
- maybe mention 2-bar concat symbol
-
