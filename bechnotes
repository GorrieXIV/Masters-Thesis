turn off hyperthreading & turboboost

/* For most accurate results:
 *  - disable hyperthreading a.k.a. hardware multithreading
 *    (Linux instructions: http://bench.cr.yp.to/supercop.html)
 *    (Mac OS X instructions: Instruments -> Preferences -> CPUs -> uncheck "Hardware Multi-Threading"
 *     http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1484684)
 *  - disable TurboBoost
 *    (Linux instructions: http://bench.cr.yp.to/supercop.html)
 *    (Max OS X: use http://www.rugarciap.com/turbo-boost-switcher-for-os-x/)
 *  - run when the computer is idle (e.g., shut down all other applications, disable network access if possible, ...)
